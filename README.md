## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: url("")
  background-repeat: no-repeat
}
```

### Continued development

I'm still developing much on my HTML and CSS and i love the fact that i'm growing daily. I look forward to more challenges

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.cpm) - This helped me when i was finding it difficult to stop my background image from repeating. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
